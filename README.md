# Android-Voting-App

## Overview

This application is specifically designed to streamline and enhance the process of electing faculty candidates at Xiamen University Malaysia. The system is structured to support three main user types. Administrative Personnel, or Admins, have the ability to start and end voting sessions, manage the list of candidates, and view the results of the elections. Students can register, log in, and cast their votes for their preferred candidates, ensuring their voice is heard in the election process. Candidates, on the other hand, can register themselves to participate in the election, providing them with the opportunity to be elected as faculty representatives.
